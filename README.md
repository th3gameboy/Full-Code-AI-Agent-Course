# AI Agent Development Course

A step-by-step curriculum for learning how to build increasingly sophisticated AI agents using Python and large language models.

## About This Course

This curriculum takes you from understanding basic AI agent concepts to creating complex multi-agent systems. Each module builds on the previous one, providing hands-on experience with progressively advanced agent architectures and capabilities.

Whether you're a developer looking to expand your AI skills or someone interested in understanding how AI agents work under the hood, this course provides practical, code-focused lessons that demonstrate true agent autonomy beyond simple LLM interactions.

## Curriculum Overview

### Module 1: Fundamentals of AI Agents
- Lesson 1: The Agent Sandbox — Structuring the Workflow
- Lesson 2: The Memory Agent — Holding Conversation Memory
- Lesson 3: The Strategist Agent — Reasoning Step-by-Step
- Lesson 4: The Phoenix Agent — Rising from Errors
- Lesson 5: The Actor Agent — Taking on Personalities and Roles
- Lesson 6: The Complete Agent — Bringing It All Together

### Module 2: Tool Integration

### Module 3: Memory Systems

### Module 4: Personality & Roles

### Module 5: Multi-Agent Systems

## What Makes This Course Different

This course emphasizes creating agents with true agency - systems that:
- Make autonomous decisions
- Break tasks into logical steps
- Self-evaluate and correct
- Maintain context across interactions
- Strategically use tools and capabilities

Rather than simply wrapping LLM API calls, you'll learn to create agents that demonstrate genuine autonomy and problem-solving abilities.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of API concepts
- Some familiarity with machine learning concepts (helpful but not required)
- Access to OpenAI, Anthropic, or other LLM APIs

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Set up your environment with the required Python packages (instructions in each lesson)
3. Add your API keys to a `.env` file
4. Start with Module 1, Lesson 1: The Agent Sandbox

## Recommended Learning Path

For best results, follow the modules in sequence. Each lesson builds on concepts from previous lessons, with increasingly complex agent architectures and capabilities.

New lessons will be released periodically, so check back for updates.
